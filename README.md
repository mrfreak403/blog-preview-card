# Blog Preview Card

This project is a simple implementation of a blog preview card using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## Description

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the blog preview card, styled with Tailwind CSS. The project displays a card with a cover image, category, publish date, title, description, and author information.

The `data.json` file contains the data that could be used in the blog preview card, making it easy to update the content without changing the HTML structure. Note that the current `index.html` uses hardcoded values.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS

## How to View

To view the blog preview card, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
